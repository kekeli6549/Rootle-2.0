Things to fix in project

You have to fix from the upload for both the student and lecturer
1. Fix student upload to make sure it goes through the checking of the department specific side then when approved shows
in both world view and department specific view page and if its checked multiple times let it  be shown multiple times

2. For the lecturer when a resource is uploaded successfully let it show on both the student and lecturers deparment view and world view

3. Let the files uploaded be able to be downloaded, by both parties.

4. let lecturer be able  to view sent files to cross check it and approve/disapprove it or delete it where necessary

5. let the User experience to reach dashboard be for student : register -> login -> dashboard  , then for lecturers(admin)
: register -> admin login -> admin dashboard
