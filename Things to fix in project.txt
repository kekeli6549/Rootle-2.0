Things to fix in project


1. let the User experience to reach dashboard be for student : register -> login -> dashboard  , then for lecturers(admin)

 and on terminate session on the admin dashboard let it be admin dashboard -> Adminlogin 

2. I Have to add a Ranking page that ranks the top contributors, with their details . It will also have badges that signify How much resources you have provided e.g Level 1 to 5, where level 1 is 10 resources, level 2 is 100 then level 3 is 250 resources then level 4 is 500 resources the level 5 is 1000 resources. There will also a be a filter for lecturers
